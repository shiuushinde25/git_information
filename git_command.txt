Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. 
It helps developers track changes in source code during software development, enabling collaboration, version tracking, and efficient project management.

Key Features
Version Control: Git keeps snapshots of your code, so you can roll back to earlier versions if needed.

Branching & Merging: You can create branches to work on features independently, then merge them back into the main codebase.

Distributed System: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history.

Collaboration: Works seamlessly with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket for team collaboration.
